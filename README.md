# Holberton Letter Particles

## Description

This project originates from a tutorial by [Frank Dvorak](https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory/featured), which introduced the foundational concepts behind text-based particle animation.

Building on this foundation, I expanded the project with interactive customization features and a user-friendly settings menu.

By leveraging HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, this project demonstrates the potential of web animations in an engaging and customizable way.

## Objectives

- Enhance my skills in JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas through creative coding.
- Develop a visually captivating animation that reacts to user input.
- Create an interactive and educational experience for users.
- Practice and refine object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.
- Implement real-time customization features via a settings menu.
- Deliver a polished and engaging user interface.
