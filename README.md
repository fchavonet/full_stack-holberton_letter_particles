## 📄 <span id="description">Description</span>

This project originates from a tutorial by [Frank Dvorak](https://www.youtube.com/@Frankslaboratory/featured), which provided the foundational concepts for the particle animation effect on text. Building on this foundation, I modified and expanded the project to include interactive customization and a user-friendly settings menu. By leveraging HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, this project demonstrates the potential of web animations in an engaging and customizable way.

## 🎓 <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

The objective of this project was to enhance my skills in JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas by exploring creative coding techniques. Through this project, I aimed to develop a visually captivating animation that responds to user input, offering an interactive and educational experience. Additionally, I focused on refining object-oriented programming principles and implementing real-time customization features to deliver a polished and engaging user interface.
